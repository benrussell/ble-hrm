This is an experimental project exploring web-bluetooth.

It implmenets a BLE Heart Rate Monitor consumer.

It allows two people wearing HRM's to have a cardio "battle".

The higher a persons heart rate rises, the faster their health bar goes down.

This was meant to be used with WHOOP 4.0 sensors in a Jiu-Jitsu setting as a training method to encourage energy conservation and heart rate awareness.

The way to win the match is to make the other person work harder.
